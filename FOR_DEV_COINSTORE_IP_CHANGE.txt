🚨 URGENT: Coinstore IP Whitelist Change Required

Railway is using IP: 3.222.129.4
Coinstore API key is whitelisted for: 54.205.35.75 (WRONG)

ACTION NEEDED:
Change Coinstore API key IP whitelist from 54.205.35.75 → 3.222.129.4

Steps:
1. Log into Coinstore dashboard → API Key Management
2. Find API key: 42b5c7c4...6ed0
3. Edit IP whitelist: Remove 54.205.35.75, Add 3.222.129.4
4. Save and wait 1-2 minutes
