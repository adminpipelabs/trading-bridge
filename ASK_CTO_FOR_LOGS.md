**Subject:** Need Railway Logs - Spread Bot Verification

## Message

```
Hi [CTO],

Can you paste the last 50-100 lines of Railway logs after a deployment?

We're looking to see if the spread bot is working or still showing errors.

**What we're looking for:**

✅ **Working:**
```
🚀 Spread bot starting
📊 Mid price: 0.00012
📝 Placing buy order: 1000 @ 0.000118
✅ Order placed
```

❌ **Not working:**
```
⚠️ Spread bot logic not yet implemented
```
or
```
❌ Balance fetch error: 1401 Unauthorized
```

Just paste the logs - that will tell us if it's actually working.

Thanks!
```
