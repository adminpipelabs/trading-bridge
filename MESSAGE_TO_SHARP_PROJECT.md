# Message to SHARP Project - IP Whitelisting Request

**Your message (good, but can be clearer):**

> "so all is ready, but we need to change IP to 5.161.64.209 and this IP if possible 162.220.232.99 so if can update keys on Coinstore and BitMart, also you need to tell Coinstore and BitMart to whitelist the IP so it enables trading. its not enough just to add the IP when create api key. as soon as we get that confirmed we ready to set up is ready."

## ✅ **What You Got Right**

- ✅ Both IPs mentioned: `5.161.64.209` and `162.220.232.99`
- ✅ Need to update keys on Coinstore and BitMart
- ✅ Need to whitelist IPs (separate from creating API key)
- ✅ Waiting for confirmation before setup

## 📝 **Suggested Clearer Version**

**Option 1 (Concise):**

> "We're ready to set up, but need IP whitelisting on both exchanges:
> 
> **IPs to whitelist:**
> - `5.161.64.209` (Hetzner VPS)
> - `162.220.232.99` (Railway static IP)
> 
> **Action required:**
> 1. Update API keys on Coinstore and BitMart
> 2. Whitelist both IPs on Coinstore dashboard (IP binding)
> 3. Whitelist both IPs on BitMart dashboard (IP whitelist)
> 
> **Important:** Just adding IP when creating API key isn't enough - IPs must be whitelisted separately in exchange dashboards.
> 
> Once confirmed, we're ready to go live."

**Option 2 (More Detailed):**

> "We're ready to deploy, but need IP whitelisting completed first:
> 
> **Two IPs need to be whitelisted:**
> - `5.161.64.209` - Hetzner VPS (primary server)
> - `162.220.232.99` - Railway static IP (backup server)
> 
> **On Coinstore:**
> - API Key: `42b5c7c40bf625e7fcffd16a654b6ed0`
> - Go to API Management → Edit API Key → IP Binding
> - Add both IPs: `5.161.64.209` and `162.220.232.99`
> 
> **On BitMart:**
> - Find your BitMart API key
> - Go to API Management → Edit → IP Whitelist
> - Add both IPs: `5.161.64.209` and `162.220.232.99`
> 
> **Critical:** Adding IP during API key creation isn't sufficient - IPs must be whitelisted separately in the exchange dashboards for trading to work.
> 
> Please confirm once both IPs are whitelisted on both exchanges, then we can proceed."
