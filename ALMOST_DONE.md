# Almost Done! 🎉

## ✅ **What's Complete**

- ✅ Code deployment (backend + frontend)
- ✅ ENCRYPTION_KEY set in Railway
- ✅ Migration scripts created and pushed

## ⚠️ **One Step Remaining**

**Run database migrations** (takes ~1 minute):

```bash
cd /Users/mikaelo/trading-bridge
railway run python railway_migrate.py
```

This creates:
- Health monitoring columns
- Trading keys table
- Health logs table
- Fixes client roles

## 🎯 **After Migrations**

Then you're **100% done** and ready for client testing! 🚀

**Status:** 95% complete - just need to run migrations!
